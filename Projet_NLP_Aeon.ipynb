       "array(['In 2017, theAustralasian Journal of Philosophyissued a rare retraction, informing their readers that one of their articles was not in fact written by a cat. The short article, a critique of David Lewis’s ‘Veridical Hallucination and Prosthetic Vision’, was published in 1981 under the name of ‘BruceLe Catt’,a figure with no discernible institutional affiliation or track record of publishing, but who appears to have been familiar with Lewis’s work. As indeed he might have been, being the beloved pet of the great American philosopher.It may not have come as a surprise to those familiar with Lewis’s work that ‘BruceLe Catt’was not the pseudonym of an astute critic, but of Lewis himself. The playfulness of Lewis’s writing is well known: for instance, thepaper‘Holes’ (1970), co-written with Stephanie Lewis, is a dialogue between two characters, ‘Argle’ and ‘Bargle’, on the ontological status of holes as found in Gruyère, crackers, paper-towel rollers and in matter more generally. Nevertheless, the attribution of the 1981paperto a cat seemed to cross a line. It may have been playful, but it was also deceptive, hence theretraction.Lewis was not the only 20th-century philosopher to publish using an invented persona. The contents page of thebookExplaining Emotions(1980), edited by Amélie Oksenberg Rorty, features the essay ‘Jealousy, Attention, and Loss’ by one Leila Tov-Ruach, listed on the Contributors page as ‘an Israeli psychiatrist, who writes and lectures on philosophic psychology’. Some readers might have noticed that this is a rather unusual name – a pun onlaila tov ruachor ‘goodnight wind’ in Hebrew – and might have had their suspicions confirmed by the fact that there is no discernible trace of this psychiatrist elsewhere on the medical or academic record. Indeed, as an erratum on the University of California Press website drily notes, Amélie Oksenberg Rorty and Leila Tov-Ruach are indeed one and the same person.The case of Tov-Ruach is somewhat different to BruceLe Catt.Rather than playfully externalising the critique of the originating philosopher’s own arguments, Tov-Ruach’s paper is included side by side with Rorty’s own contributions to a volume that she herself edited. The two write on different topics and have their own biographical entries in the volume but are not in opposition. It is certainly a more elaborate and less obviously tongue-in-cheek intervention than Lewis’s use of BruceLe Cattas an antagonist.What are the ethics of this kind of pseudonymous publication? When they realised what had happened, theAustralasian Journal of Philosophyand the University of California Press evidently felt it necessary, as a matter of academic ethics, to issue a clarification on the identity of the true authors. They were prompted to do so by the unflagging work of Michael Dougherty, the Sister Ruth Caspar Chair in Philosophy at Ohio Dominican University, who has spent years unmasking cases of misattribution, and downright plagiarism along with murkier, quirkier cases like these. For Dougherty, such cases are primarily about disciplinary morality, amounting to a wilful obstruction of the scholarly endeavour. On the Rorty/Tov-Ruach case, hewrites:It’s odd to have a dialogue with yourself under two names in the published literature. I have no idea why she is doing this.Dr Rortyis a distinguished philosopher, and the use of pseudonyms can impede a genuine history of philosophy.It is the implied question in Dougherty’s statement that interests me: whyisshe doing it? Why would any philosopher write under somebody else’s name, pretend to be someone that they are not? If plagiarism is the intellectual sin of taking credit for someone else’s ideas, what are we to think of its opposite: pinning one’s own ideas on somebody else who doesn’t even exist?While it might seem odd in the world of contemporary journal publication, smuggling ideas under someone else’s name is rather more common in the history of philosophy than you might think. Medieval philosophy in particular abounds with texts that blur the boundaries between anonymity, pseudonymity and straightforward authorship. Consider the various ‘pseudos-’ – from pseudo-Augustine, pseudo-Aristotle, pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite – that proliferated in the late antique and medieval periods. Many of the medieval scholars used this kind of device to invoke the authority of an older figure for their ideas; humble monks who wrote (if writing under any name at all) under the names of the mighty dead to gain intellectual clout and authority.Indeed, in a slightly different form, this practice has far deeper roots. Any philosophical dialogue using the names of real figures does something similar: is Plato’s Socrates the ‘real’ Socrates, or a mouthpiece for Plato’s own views, or somewhere in between? Was Plato’s Protagoras the ‘real’ Protagoras, or just a foil for Plato’s own ideas? And, if the latter, is there really anything wrong with this?CourtesyCasa Fernando Pessoa, Lisbon, PortugalAnd what about when the name under which a philosopher writes does not refer to a real individual?Søren Kierkegaardwrote under a great many names: Johannes Climacus, Constantin Constantius, Victorin Victorius Victor, Johannesde Silentioare a few of them, none of whom is anything but the creative imagining of Kierkegaard himself. In fact, it is perhaps more proper to call these personages ‘heteronyms’, as developed later in the works ofFernando Pessoa, in which the different names are not simply alternative labels for an identical author hiding behind the label, but denote fully conceived individuals, each with their own personality, appearance and distinctive literary style. Pessoa himself conjured more than 60 such persons, in addition to two ‘semi-heteronyms’ that constituted a ‘mere mutilation’ of his own personal style, and finally the single ‘orthonym’ that referred to the origin points of all of these names: Pessoa himself.This thinker, who does not exist, nevertheless takes up a particular perspective on the worldRorty’s use of an alias is in many ways easier to understand, mainly because she tells us precisely why she wrote under a name that was not her own. Indeed, Leila Tov-Ruach was not her only pseudonym. In addition to an Israeli psychiatrist, Rorty also tried her hand at writing as a Chinese Platonist and, in her editedcollectionPhilosophers on Education(1998), she explains why she chose to write her article on ‘Plato’s Counsel on Education’ under the name of Zhang LoShan:Ever since teaching a course in the history of philosophy in the People’s Republic of China in 1981, and finding students and colleagues there passionately interested in Plato, I had been trying to see him through their eyes, with their preoccupations … Although I wrote that essay, it is, in a perfectly straightforward way, not strictly speaking mine … It is an experiment I strongly recommend to all serious scholars: surprising features emerge from the exercise.The aim of writing under the name of this nonexistent philosopher was, in Rorty’s words, ‘intellectual empathy’, understood as the attempt to enter into the mind of another thinker, a kind of exercise. This thinker, who does not exist, nevertheless takes up a particular perspective on the world, a perspective that rests on a different set of assumptions and preoccupations from the author’s. When the pseudonymous author imaginatively occupies such a perspective through the processes of intellectual empathy, they might thereby see things differently (as might readers).Today, some people might object to the case of Rorty-as-Zhang-LoShan on grounds of cultural appropriation, and perhaps Rorty would admit that this is precisely the point: to appropriate a perspective that is not one’s own, that is not anybody’s at all (though, for her, presumably that wouldn’t have the negative connotations of ‘cultural appropriation’). And perhaps this is why she – and Kierkegaard and Pessoa, but not Plato or pseudo-Augustine – chose names of thinkers who never existed: so as to have the freedom not only to appropriate an existing perspective, but also to create and inhabit one anew.But none of these examples, from philosophical felines to pseudo-Augustine or imaginary Chinese Platonists, is quite as perplexing as that of theḤatäta Zera Yacob. TheḤatäta, or ‘enquiry’ (the root of which, ሐ-ተ-ተ, in the ancient Ethiopian language of Geʽez literally means ‘to investigate, examine, search’ ) is an unusual work of philosophy for a number of reasons. It is not only a philosophical treatise but also an autobiography, a religious meditation and a witness of the religious wars that plagued Ethiopia in the early17th century;it presents a theodicy and cosmological argument apparently independent of other traditions of Christian thought; it employs a subtle philosophical vocabulary that is virtually without precursors. Finally, and most perplexingly, the progenitor of these ideas, the Zera Yacob who is the subject of the autobiography and gives his name to the title, may never have existed.Why might we think this? The text is composed in the voice of one Zera Yacob, a man born to poor parents in ‘the lands of the priests of Aksum’ in northern Ethiopia around the turn of the17th century.Driven from his hometown by religious conflict between Orthodox ‘kopt’ and Catholic ‘ferenj’, our eponymous narrator Zera Yacob flees to the hills and finds a cave in which he ‘meditated all day on humanity’s quarrels and wickedness, and also on the wisdom of the Lord their creator, who keeps silent when they act wickedly in his name, persecute their neighbours, and kill their own brothers and sisters.’ The basic problem of his philosophy is how to understand how God allowed this violent conflict to take place – a version of the classic problem of evil – and further to understand what, if anything, is true in religion.In the most strident chapters, Zera Yacob critiques the religious practices and social organisation ofhis dayZera Yacob poses the problem by asking how we can decide between two religions whose justifications and standards of justification are internal to their own systems of thought – who ‘decided everything according to [their] own creed’:Where will I find someone who will decide [on the religions and creeds] truthfully? Because [just as] my religion seems true to me, so does another’s religion seem true to them.The problem is not only that different groups disagree, but that there seems no way to resolve these disagreements without bloodshed.His answer is remarkable. The only thing that can decide between competing religious claims is something that every human has inside them: the god-given faculty oflebbuna(variously translated as ‘reason’, ‘intelligence’ and ‘understanding’) that allows us to perceive what is right and wrong, good and bad by means of it being attuned to a kind of pre-established harmony between the creator, creation at large and this faculty itself.Lebbunais common tokoptandferenj, man and woman, young and old: truth and goodness is accessible to all, equally. And yet humans do not use it. It is onerous to apply one’s reason, and mankind is by nature lazy, preferring to be led by received wisdom.The most strident chapters of the book follow, with Zera Yacob using the normative standards set bylebbunato critique the religious practises and social organisation of his day. He criticises slavery for treating man like a beast; asceticism for perverting natural desires; and the practice of marriage for treating a wife as the slave of a husband.When the civil unrest ends with the death of the emperor, he returns to society, settling in the town of Enfraz where he finds work and eventually an intellectual disciple in the form of a youth named Walda Heywat, who urges his teacher to write down his reflections before his death. He presents here a vision of the good life as living in harmony with the natural order of creation, earning his sustenance and that of his family by honest work. The historical details of the political background are all accurate, the language of the text beautiful, lyrical Geʽez. So why think that this character, so convincingly evoked, may never have existed?The troubled afterlife of the text begins when the work is ‘discovered’ in 1852 by a lonely Capuchin monk named Giustoda Urbinoin the highlands of Ethiopia. Before this date, there is no mention of the text in the historical record. The work was sent off toda Urbino’spatron back in Paris, the Irish-Basque explorer, linguist and astronomer Antoine d’Abbadie, and placed in the Ethiopian collections of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Over the next couple of decades, scholars flocked to consult this fascinating, seemingly unprecedented text. TheḤatätawas edited and translated into Russian and Latin, and began to gain a wider readership among European intellectuals.Then in 1920, an Italian Orientalist named Carlo Conti Rossini published an article in theJournal Asiatique, claiming that, far from being a masterpiece of 17th-century Ethiopian thought, theḤatätawas in fact a forgery, composed by the man who had claimed to discover it:da Urbino.Conti Rossini had been tipped off by an Ethiopian convert to Catholicism thatda Urbinohad been scheming with local scholars to create ‘heretical’ and ‘masonic’ works to undermine Catholicism and Ethiopian orthodoxy alike. Conti Rossini now started seeing proof everywhere, adducing philological arguments and cultural speculations in equal measure to the conclusion that this book was written by an Italian in the19th century,not an Ethiopian inthe 17th.Conti Rossini was the pre-eminent Ethiopianist of interwar Europe, and his arguments were eventually accepted by almost all scholars, including those who had spent so long translating and commentating upon the work. But Conti Rossini was also a colonial administrator in Italian East Africa, and a supporter of Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia, even going so far as to publish an article in 1935 titled ‘Ethiopia Is Incapable of Civil Progress’, arguing that the country could, indeed should, be colonised by a ‘civilising’ power, explicitly invoking his refutation of theḤatätaas part of his argument.If faking a passport gets you somewhere, what does a fake work of philosophyget you?The argument has raged for more than a century now, with new arguments being made on both sides. Claude Sumner, a Jesuit missionary who called himself ‘Canadian by birth, Ethiopian by choice’, made a passionate case for an Ethiopian authorship in his five-volumeEthiopian Philosophy(1974-8), building on the argument of Ethiopian scholars like Alemayyehu Moges and Amsalu Aklilu. The French historian Anaïs Wion has produced an ingenious argument against an Ethiopian authorship in herseriesof articlesThe History of a Genuine Fake Philosophical Treatise(2013), and these arguments have beentaken upby scholars like Fasil Merawi and Daniel Kibret back in Addis Ababa. Finally, the late, great scholar of Ethiopian manuscripts Getatchew Haile reversed his position, held for half a century, that the work was a forgery in a paper published shortly before his death in 2021. It is no exaggeration to say that today, as interest in theḤatätabegins to peak once again with a series of newbooks,podcastsand the publication of a newtranslationof theḤatäta, the question of its author’s existence is in limbo.The difference between the case of Leila Tov-Ruach and Zera Yacob is that the identity of the author of theḤatätareally seems to matter. Many Ethiopian intellectuals are understandably proud of the work, holding it up as a masterpiece of 17th-century literature and a foundation of an alternative, specifically Ethiopian path to modernity. And they are understandably furious at the idea that the writings of a fascist intellectual might deprive one of their greatest geniuses of his rightful credit.In Europe and the United States, philosophers keen to diversify and decolonise their curriculums have seized on Zera Yacob as evidence of an ‘African Enlightenment’, as an African Descartes or Kant. As Sumner put it, theḤatätademonstrates that ‘modern philosophy, in the sense of a personal rationalistic critical investigation, began in Ethiopia with Zera Yacob at the same time as in England and in France.’ If the work is a forgery, it seems that theḤatätacannot fulfil this lofty role allotted to it. The implication seems to be that, if it is not written by a 17th-century Ethiopian scholar, it is not all that interesting or importantafter all.So it seems that wedovery much care who wrote it. But should we? The assumption on the side of both the proponents and opponents of authenticity is that either the work is totally genuine, in which case it can be used to diversify and decolonise, or else it is totally fake, a ‘mere forgery’ and of little interest, other than perhaps as a case of late-colonial cultural appropriation (or immersion, if one prefers).But what is a ‘mere forgery’ anyway? If you forge a passport, you are creating a fake document that permits you to cross borders as if it were real. If you forge a work of art, you are creating a convincing (and therefore lucrative) fake that can be attributed to a known artist and sold as if it were genuine. But what might the forging of a work of philosophy be, beyond attributing the work to someone else,à lapseudo-Augustine or pseudo-Aristotle? If faking a painting gets you something and faking a passport gets you somewhere, what does a fake work of philosophyget you?Presumably, what we care about most in a philosophical text are its arguments, its attempts to get at the truth and its means of getting there. If the argument is what interests us, then should the authorship matter, given that the argument is exactly the same, regardless who wrote it? Of course, historical context is important, both for understanding how the text might have come to be and what the text means. But unless this exploring of context is employed in the service of understanding and elucidating the arguments, we are treating the work as a historical curiosity rather than a source of insight. In the case of theḤatäta Zera Yacob, this would be a mistake, for the arguments are powerful and abidingly relevant. These arguments – about the causes of human suffering and conflict, the epistemology of disagreement and the twin temptations of relativism and blind absolutism, the relation between the world and our cognitive faculties – are precisely what tends to fall out when the discussion of theḤatätafocuses exclusively on the topic of authenticity.We might conclude by offering a different sense of philosophical forgery, one less concerned with the cultural politics of a particular text than the words it leaves on the page. Forging in this sense might have more to do with the work of the blacksmith than of the counterfeiter. Rather than forging as deception, we might think of forgery as creation, namely as the creation of new words and, with it, new ideas. Consider that whoever wrote theḤatätadid so in a language, namely Geʽez, that previously quite literally did not have the words for expressing its most central ideas. Whoever wrote theḤatätaforged a philosophical-conceptual vocabulary.This process of linguistic innovation, of coining new terms and adapting existing words to new meanings is by no means unique to Geʽez. It is more than20 centuriessince Cicero attempted to ‘teach philosophy to speak Latin’, not only by importing originally Greek words into Latin (dialectica,politica), but by teaching philosophy new terms (moralia,naturalis) from his native language. In a way, it takes place every time philosophy learns to ‘speak’ in a new language, including our own: we owe a great many words, both arcane (‘quiddity’, ‘apperception’) and commonplace (‘politics’, ‘nature’ and ‘self’) to the translation of philosophy into English in the 16th and17th centuries.But rarely has it happened so suddenly, in such a concentrated way in a single text. This is impressive enough if its author is a 17th-century Ethiopian named Zera Yacob. If it’s the work of a 19th-century forger, it is an utterly astounding work of linguistic and cultural immersion.Ultimately, the words on the page should be more philosophically interesting than the identity of the person who wrote them, and therefore theḤatäta(and, by extension, other such contested texts) should be judged on the philosophical quality and linguistic innovations, not on the name at the top of the page. There is a sense in which the identity of an author matters. Rorty wrote Tov-Ruach and Zhang LoShan into existence, and in doing so created two distinct philosophical voices, just as Kierkegaard conjured countless original perspectives. Plato wrote the perspectives of Glaucon, Protagoras and Thrasymachus in a way that may or may not have corresponded to their real views. Zera Yacob may be one such voice that is an unknowable mix of real historical individual and literary creation. But, then again, so is Socrates.',\n",

       "array(['In a popular article inScientific Americanin 1955, at the dawn of the molecular genetic age, the Soviet defector, physicist and polymath George Gamow wrote: ‘Comparing a living cell with a factory, we can consider its nucleus as the manager’s office and the chromosomes as the filing cabinets where all the production plans and blueprints are stored.’ InMay 2023,when Eric Green, director of theUS NationalHuman Genome Research Institute, announced the newlyreleasedhuman pangenome – a collection of genomes representing the spectrum of human diversity in aggregate – he described it as ‘providing an expanding view of humanity’s DNA blueprint’.The ‘genetic blueprint’ is just one example of the rich linguistic vocabulary of the genome. The production of proteins from DNA is called gene ‘expression’ and involves the ‘transcription’ of the DNA ‘code’ into ‘messenger’ RNA, followed by its ‘translation’ into the sequence of amino acids that create a protein molecule. The blueprint idea implies that genes encode the general shape and function of the body, and that developmental differences from these encoded plans are perturbations or errors around a prior design or evolved intention. The genetic blueprint reinforces the idea that the answers to all interesting biological questions lie in our genes, and that other lines of research are either indirect or trivial.InWho Wrote the Book of Life?(2000), the historian of science Lily Kaydocumentedhow linguistic metaphors in genetics morphed, during the mid-20th century, from descriptive analogies into scientific ‘ontologies’ – concepts about what genes really are, and what they do. These ontologies morphed from metaphors into specific concepts, and guided scientific research itself.Since Gamow coined the genetic blueprint, however, we have learned an astounding amount about the developmental and physiological regulation of gene expression. In 1980, for instance, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschausdiscoveredseveral entirely new classes of genes inDrosophilafruit flies that were later found to regulate development in all multicellular animal bodies from humans to horseshoe crabs. Their discovery initiated a new era of explosive research in molecular developmental biology, and they went on to win the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. We now understand that the embryonic development of the complex organs and the anatomical features of animal bodies involve detailedmolecular conversationsbetween cells and tissues through which cells and groups of cells establish their identities, achieve their complex morphologies, and establish their spatial and physiological relations. Although cells draw on genomic resources in this process, it is the molecules, cells, tissues and organs of the body that are the activeagentsin its material development.It is hard to underestimate how revolutionary and unexpected Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus’s discoveries were. Literallynothingabout intercellular molecular signalling pathways and the expansive homology of developmental regulatory genes acrossallphyla of multicellular animals had been predicted by the previous eight decades of genetic and evolutionary research. Until the discovery of these genes and their function, no one knew that the same evolutionary patterns and molecular signals had been a reutilisation in the development of so many diverse cells types and body parts across so many species.The idea of the genetic blueprint, and its underlying cybernetic definition of communication as the faithful exchange of information, prevented us from seeing the body as it really is – not the product of an algorithm, but a complex, molecularly networked social becoming. It is time to replace the genetic blueprint idea in light of contemporary developmental biology. But what alternative concept can both communicate the necessary complexityandfoster productive scientific research? A surprisingly productive solution comes not from cybernetics, computer science or the theory of algorithms, but from the humanistic disciplines of the philosophy of language and feminist queer theory.According to the blueprint idea, the body is a material realisation of a pre-existing, molecularly encoded, anatomical and physiological plan. In this view, gene expression constitutes what the 20th-century philosopher of languageJ L Austinreferred to as arepresentational(orconstative) speech act – an expression that describes, or refers, to something in the world, like the sentenceLe chapeau de ma mère est sur la table(‘My mother’s hat is on the table’). In contrast, Austin also recognisedperformativespeech acts, or statements that perform actionsin the world– like the wedding vow ‘I do’, or the challenge ‘I bet you a hundred bucks that the Sox are going to win tonight.’ The difference between representational and performative speech is more than the difference between nouns and verbs. Verbs can refer to, or describe, actions, but performative speechisaction – action in thesocialworld.Genes are not, and cannot be, the strict causes of the material body and its variationsIn the 1960s and ’70s,Austin’s ideathat language could bothdescribeandact inthe world had a profound impact on comparative literature, literary criticism and the humanities, playing a key role in philosophy and literary analysis. Unexpectedly, the same concept has the power to fuel ametaphoricrevolution in molecular genetics, developmental biology, and evolutionary biology today.Even casual consideration makes it clear that gene expression isnota material representation of a blueprint or plan. Rather, gene expression isaction– a materialdoingby the cell. Gene expression creates material consequences. Enzymescatalysemolecular reactions. Hormones circulate systemically in the bloodstream, andbindto coevolved receptors, expressed only by certain cells. Paracrine signalling molecules diffuse from one cell to another, and likewise bind to coevolved receptors on the membranes of other, nearby cells. Upon binding, endocrine and paracrine signals can initiate cascades of gene regulatory changes within those cells. Transcription factorsbind, or not, to coevolved promotor or enhancer sites on the DNA, leading to theupregulation, orsuppression, of theexpressionof downstream genes.In short, gene expression isperformative, not referential. The body is not a representation of a genetic blueprint or algorithm. Rather, the biological individualusesits genome in the creation of itself – its material body. And because the actions of all these genes is contingent upon many other upstream and downstream molecularandcellular participants, genes are not, and cannot be, the strict causes of the material body and its variations. In an echo of Immanuel Kant, the organism is the cause of its own development and homeostasis.Nowhere have the consequences of Austinian performativity been more elaborately investigated and powerfully applied than in the feminist discipline of queer theory – a field of philosophy and literary criticism that explores the nature and consequences of individual differences in gender, sex and gender identity. In this diverse field, the queer theory of gender performativity has specific and productive relevance to genetics, as well as to developmental and evolutionary biology.In the 1980s, the feminist philosopher Judith Butler argued that gender is not synonymous with biological sex, nor a purely social construct, but aperformativesocial action by individuals within their social environments. Accordingly, gender is a repeated set of social actions,andan individualised expression throughdoing –an act of self-becoming.In Butler’swords, gender performa\\xadtivity ‘carries the double-meaning of “dramatic” and “non-referential”.’InBodies That Matter(1993), Butlerwrotethat performativity is ‘that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains’.Despite being a statement aboutgender performativity, it would be difficult to find a more concise and accurate description of the mechanisms of genetic action in bodily development. Take a glance at your hands. Their form, their parts, their hierarchically interconnected structures and their complex modes of function all reflect your individual history as a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a primate, an ape, a human being, and the child of your parents. Your hands also embody specific aspects of your lived experience in an environment, perhaps as a manual labourer (callouses), an office worker (carpal tunnel numbness), a weekend gardener (rose thorn scratches, and soil under the nails), or the pursuit of a specific gender aesthetic (manicured and painted nails). Your hands might resemble those of your parents in specific ways, but you didn’t inherityourhands fromyour parent’shands. Rather, like an individual’s gender, every pair of hands is aniterativerealisation of this complex morphology.Our bodies are material iterations of a human being. But how? Through the scientific revolution instigated by Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, we now know that our complex bodies develop through the exchange and management of intercellular signals – in an elaborate, intercellular molecular discourse.Text messages among teens are like those cell-to-cell (or paracrine) signalsWhydiscourse? In the humanities, the termdiscoursedescribes the way in which modes of structured communication create and constrain what it is possible to communicate; what kinds of communications have value, meaning or consequence; who is authorised to be a legitimate speaker or receiver; and how those constraints contribute to identities and boundaries. The humanistic concept of discourse captures the fact that the molecular signalling among the cells of the body is highly structured. Most cells are both producersandreceivers of chemical signals. Cells are capable of attending to specific signals, or not, depending upon what receptor proteins they express. The process of developing from a generalised state of open possibilities – such as an embryonic epidermal skin cell – to a specific developmental state – like a hair, sweat gland, or nail cell – involves the individuation of discourses among groups of socially interacting cells.Imagine what happens as an American teenager prepares for the weekend ahead. On Wednesday night, she receives a text from a friend with a proposal to go to a new movie on Friday night. ‘Awesome!’ is the response. Soon, other friends are recruited by additional texts to the same collaborative project, or developmental fate. By Thursday night, however, after the group has grown in size, and other interactions have occurred during the school day, more texts go out expressing problems or alternatives. ‘That movie sucks!’ That person ‘dissed me’. Or ‘My parents will be out of town, so I am having a party!’ By Friday morning, the social group has fissioned, several alternative possibilities have been envisioned, additional new individuals have been recruited, and each individual must decide to pursue a specific activity, which precludes the others. In parallel, the group texts have also channelled into separate discussions with fewer or no overlapping individuals. At school on Friday afternoon, the princi\\xadpal gives an announcement over the intercom admonishing all students to summon their best behaviour for the upcoming homecoming weekend, and sends an identical email to all students. By the time Friday evening arrives, all the parents in all the families are inevitably trying to figure out where the hell theirchildren are.The text messages among teens are like those cell-to-cell (or paracrine) signals. The principal’s announcements and emails act like widely broadcast hormones (or endocrine signals). The effectiveness of either in influencing a specific teen’s behaviour depends on a bal\\xadance among all incoming messages, their relationships with other signallers, and whether anyone is even listening. Each teen brings their own individual agency to these interactions, but none is entirely free from social influence, and decisions are made in common with multiple others in likeminded associations or cliques. In summary, highly structured, molecular discourses lead to the development of cellular identities with distinct morphologies, anatomical boundaries and physiological functions. The context-dependent admission and exclusion of certain signals allow groups of cells to co-organise themselves into coherent, anatomically nested and functionally integrated tissues and organs of the body. Being a specific neuron, muscle cell or liver cell is always preceded by the discursive establishment of a cell identity in social collaboration with other cells.Of course, cells take material actions through their gene expression, morphologies and functions. Becoming a specific kind of cell means expressing certain structural proteins – bricks and mortar, if you will – of that cell type. But the majority of genes involved in development are actually involved in the regulation of the intercellular and intracellular discourses that contribute to the decision to become a specific cell type, and to express the appropriate structural proteins. Thus, the primary goal of molecular discourses during development is to ‘regulate and constrain’ the process itself. Ultimately, expression is performative – according to dialogue and need, and not by code or algorithm.It is time to abandon the genomic blueprint and embrace the performative body –ourperformative bodies. Gene expression is action within the diverse, anatomically structured social milieu of the trillions of cells of the human body. The genome is not the cause of the body, but a historically derived set of lexical resources to beusedby the cells and tissues of the body intheirdiscursive realisation of the self. In short, we areperformance all the way down.With its catchy, intellectual mouthfeel, the word ‘performative’ has recently moved from the obscurity of queer theory into contemporary lingo and anti-woke critique. But the popular connotations of the term to mean false, inauthentic, shallow or just-for-show do not communicate its original meaning of ‘non-representational expression as social action’. Indeed, because we areperformance all the way down, there is nothing else that we really are. Thus, performativity does not imply inauthenticity; it implies individuality enacted in an environment through social discourse.Butwhois doing all that performing? Butler wrote that ‘performativity implies agency’. Likewise, the performativity of the body means that hormones, cell-to-cell signalling molecules and their receptors, transcription factors and their binding sites, cells, signalling centres, tissues and glandsallhave evolved agency – that is, capacity for action that is contingent upon the prior history of selection on their functions. For example, a hormone cannotcauseany cell to do anything. To be receptive to any hormonal signal, a cell must first express the corresponding, coevolved receptor for that hormone. Thus, cells have the developmental agency to tune in, or tune out, the molecular signals produced by other cells and glands within the body. The active, environmentally contingent participation of hundreds of cell types in the body’s development and physiology are evidence of their evolved agency, not of a blueprint encoded in their shared genomes.This talk of molecular and cellular agency might sound outlandish, but remember that, for nearly50 years,biologists and the public have become perfectly comfortable with Richard Dawkins’sconceptof the ‘selfish gene’. What does such ‘selfishness’ mean in this context if not the evolved agency to pursue one’s goals and interests? Of course, the agency of genes feels intellectually comforting to many because it reinforces thereductive powerof the genetic blueprint. But the evolved agency of genes does not negate or deny the agency of proteins, gene-binding sites, cells, tissues and organs. The performative biology I am proposing requires merely expanding that agency to encompass other biological molecules, cells, tissues and organs – the entities that actuallydoeverything in biology.Not surprisingly, given the focus of queer theory on variations in human gender, the performativity of our material bodies has no more profound implication than in the consideration of individual human sex. As the literary scholar Eve Kosofsky SedgwickwroteinTouching Feeling(2003), performativity isanti-essentialist. Once we recognise the power of discourse – whether it is verbal, gestural, textualormolecular – to make and to affect reality itself, we realise that such discourses do not, andcannot, represent any prior, individual essence.Thus, individual sex isnotan essential scientific fact about a fertilised egg, an individual cell, or a specific combination of chromosomes, genes or hormone levels. Like the material body itself, individual sex – the anatomical and physiological capacities to reproduce in particular, structured ways – is a becoming, an individual realisation that unfolds during life through thedoingof life.Sexual development involves the use of our genes, but is not defined by them. Instead, the functions of specific chromosomes, genes, hormones, signalling molecules and receptors in human sexual development are each contingent upon many other, upstream and downstream players in the embodied, molecular/material discourse of sexual development.For example, the SRY gene – short for ‘Sex-determining Region on the Y’– has been referred to thousands of times in the scientific literature as the ‘master switch’ of mammalian sex determination. SRY is a transcription factor that binds to an enhancer upstream on the DNA of the SOX9 gene, another transcription factor that, among many functions in the body, can play a role in testis development within the embryonic gonad.However, this ‘master switch’ is not the master of anything. In fact, SRY is mess! In apaperwith the ironic title ‘SRY: The Master Switch in Mammalian Sex Determination’ (2010), the developmental biologists Kenichi Kashimada and Peter Koopman describe SRY as ‘a fragile and partly debilitated gene’ in a ‘degraded state’. In anotherpaperentitled ‘SRY and the Hesitant Beginnings of Male Development’ (2007), Juan Carlos Polanco and Koopman further write: ‘[I]nstead of the robust gene that one might expect as the pillar of male sexual development, SRY function hangs by a thin thread.’ (They never explain why one would expect male sexual development to require a ‘pillar’ in the first place.)SRY’s precarity demonstrates that evolution itself isgeneratively queeringLike the trope of the fragile male ego, the molecular development of mammalian testes appears to be intrinsically precarious. All of this biomedical anxiety about the molecular impotence of the mammalian sexual ‘master switch’ comes from the volumes of real data documenting the numerous hurdles SRY must overcome to perform its simple and singular function – turn on the SOX9 gene in the developing gonad. After transcription, SRY messenger RNAs must first be stabilised by the WT1+KTS protein isoform until they can be translated into a protein. Then, the SRY protein must be phosphorylated in one spot, acetylated in another, and bound to two other chaperone proteins – calmodulin andimportin-β– before it can move into the cell nucleus. Once there, it must unbind calmodulin andimportin-β,and then bind to a specific ‘ACAA’ amino acid sequence in the minor groove of the DNA upstream of SOX9, and bend the DNA to a 60˚-85˚ angle to turn on SOX9 expression.However, every single one of these events can be disrupted. We know this through the genetic investigation of individuals who were raised as girls but unexpectedly never reached puberty, and were found to be XY individuals without testes. The molecular hurdles that SRY faces in performing its function arenothonest handicaps designed by evolution to ensure that only thebestembryos get to become male. Rather, each of these events evolved to compensate for another novel and deleterious mutation that arose in SRY during its long evolutionary history on the lonely, un-recombining Y chromosome. And each and every baroque compensation for SRY’s functional problems becomesanothercontingent, discursive dependency leading to ever-richer opportunities for the origin of developmental differences in embodied sex. SRY’s precarity demonstrates that evolution itself isgeneratively queering.Many more examples of differences in human sexual development demonstrate that SRY is neither necessary nor sufficient for testis development, or the establishment of anatomical maleness. Molecular developmental biology demonstrates that sex is not a scientific fact about a zygote, a cell, a gene or any chromosomal combination. Nothing can ‘determine’ or define individual sex other than its achievement. Individual sex is a becoming. To paraphraseSimone de Beauvoir, at the molecular, cellularandcultural level, ‘To be a woman (or a man), is to havebecomeone.’The implications of all this are profound. Differences in sexual development among individuals – including what are often referred to as intersex conditions – are not examples of a sexual binary gone wrong, but evidence that there isn’t an individual sexual binary in the first place. If individual sex is not a genetically defined essence – an inherent and indispensable fact etched in our genomes – then there is no individual sexual essence to be abandoned, or to be adopted, through trans experience. Nor is there any sexual essence to be defended within cis experience. All of our sexual bodies are enacted through an individualised process of performative becoming. That is what it means to live in a body. Trans experience is just a more complicated becoming.The performativity of our bodies extends beyond gender/sex to every aspect of our biology. Despite decades-long efforts to reduce human complexity and diversity to our genomes, science keeps reconfirming the importance of our individuality. All of our diverse and complex traits – from intelligence and athletic, linguistic or musical abilities to our risk of complex diseases, like cancer and heart attack – are best understood as aspects of ourperformedselves. The genetic inputs on such complex traits are highly diverse, involving interactions among many rare variations of many genes. Consequently, when biologists identify all the heritable genetic variations that affect the risk of heart attack, we can explain less than10 percent of it. This ‘missing heritability’ demonstrates that we humans are overwhelmingly genetically variable. It means that the genetic contributions toyourrisk of heart attack or cancer are the result of gene-by-gene-by-gene… interactions that are virtually unique to you. The consequences of these myriad genetic variations manifest precisely within the complex ways that we develop individually – our complex, discursive becomings. Through the enormous effort to uncover the universal human genetic blueprint – including the most recent pangenomic edition – science has instead revealed our overwhelming, stubbornly persistent human individuality.Biology needs queer theory to get the body rightAll of the most complex and distinctive innovations as human beings – our creative intelligences, our diverse personalities, our rich psychological capacities, and our facility for language – are examples ofperformativeevolutionary novelties. In the same way that gender performativity identifies the role of agents in our social environment in our gender becomings, human psychology, intelligence and language capacity all arose through coevolutionary feedback between our developing brains and our increasingly complex social environments, which cannot be encoded within our genomes. Our sensory and subjective experiences are not projections of data onto neural algorithms, but dynamic actions taken by every individual in interaction with the world. More than any other aspects of the human phenotype, human psychology, personality and behaviour are explicitly Austinian performatives –doingsin our social world.The performative understanding of our physical bodies and minds provides a single, unified conceptual framework for simultaneous science-culture enquiry and dialogue about evolution, biology, genetics, psychology and gender/sex. This shift in scientific thinking is not an accommodation to culture but, rather, an improvement in scientific understanding in its own right. Biology needs queer theory to get the body right. Although some may find this surprising, it means simply that scientists can learn about science from people who are not scientists.Performative biology establishes an intellectually queer space in the heart of molecular genetics, developmental biology and evolutionary biology. Scientifically, performative biology calls for a renewed focus of biological research onalllevels in the complex hierarchical process of organismal development and evolution, not just on genes. But this metaphoric revolution will require some fundamental rethinking about how biology is taught, researched and funded. Performative biology also extends an invitation to develop new directions and priorities in scientific research, by new generations of researchers, conceived in the fact that organisms are complex, individual becomings, not material products of a blueprint. Lastly, performative biology establishes an intellectual path for queer and trans scientists and their allies to pursue scientific research in molecular biology, developmental biology, evolutionary biology and psychology in ways that connect personally and intellectually to their lived experiences and identities.',\n",
